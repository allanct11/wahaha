Assuming that the access.log is at the same directory, most countries can be calculated by running the script `./ip2geo.sh`


First the bash script will count the number of each unique IP
Then the IP will be converted to its corresponding country by running the curl command
Finally the number beside the countries will be summed up, by sorting the number in a descending order, the country with the most hit can be calculated
